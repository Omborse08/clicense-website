# CLicense

An open-source web application focused on simplifying and explaining software licenses in clear, human-readable language.

## Overview
CLicense aims to reduce confusion around software licenses by presenting key terms and implications in a simple and accessible format.

The project is designed to be:
- Transparent
- Open-source
- Easy to understand
- Practical for real-world use

## Why This Project Exists
Software licenses are often difficult to interpret, especially for developers and founders who want to quickly understand what they can and cannot do.

CLicense exists to:
- Lower the barrier to understanding licenses
- Encourage informed usage of open-source software
- Provide clarity without legal jargon

---

## How to Use
Using CLicense is intentionally simple.

1. Copy the URL of any software Model  
   (for example: MIT, Apache, GPL, etc.)
2. Paste the Model URL into the input field on the website
3. Submit the link to receive a simplified explanation of the license

No setup or configuration is required for basic usage.

## How It’s Built
The initial structure of the website was created using AI-assisted tooling.  
All content refinement, structural decisions, and integrations are handled Manually and AI.

This approach enables faster iteration while maintaining full control over the system.
