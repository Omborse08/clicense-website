## 📖 Overview
CLicense solves the "Terms & Conditions" headache. It interprets legal software licenses and presents key permissions, limitations, and obligations in a simplified format for developers and founders.

### Key Goals:
- **Clarity:** Break down legal jargon.
- **Transparency:** Open-source and community-driven.
- **Efficiency:** Quick pasted-link analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture
This project follows a **Hybrid Development Approach**, combining modern AI-assisted prototyping with manual engineering refinements.

- **Frontend:** React / Vite (Structured via AI-assisted architecture for rapid UI/UX deployment).
- **Current Core:** Prompt-engineered logic for license interpretation.
- **Planned Backend:** Transitioning to a dedicated **Java (Spring Boot)** microservice for robust license parsing and data handling.

## 🧠 Why This Project?
Software licenses are barriers to innovation. CLicense was built to:
1. Lower the barrier for understanding open-source compliance.
2. Foster informed usage of community software.
3. Serve as my initial journey into **Product Lifecycle Management** and **Full-stack Development**.

## 🏗️ How It Was Built
I believe in using the best tools available. The initial skeleton of CLicense was created using **AI-assisted tooling (Lovable/v0)** to focus on rapid prototyping and user flow. 

As a **Backend Engineering student (Java & Python)**, I am currently refactoring the core logic manually to move away from AI dependency and towards a scalable, engineered system.

---

## 📅 Roadmap (The Engineer's Path)
- [ ] **Phase 1:** Complete manual refactoring of the frontend components.
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Implement a **Java-based Backend** for secure API handling.
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Integrate **Python-based Web Scraping** for real-time license updates.
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Add Unit Testing using **JUnit** to ensure reliability.

## 🤝 Open Source & Contributions
CLicense is developed in public. I am a firm believer in the **Open Source Philosophy**. 
- Feedback is welcome.
- Contributions to the upcoming Java backend are highly encouraged.
